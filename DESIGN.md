For our starting page, we created a design that is very similar to an old-fashioned video game starting screen. Thus, in HTML, we implemented a pixelated city picture as the background, the title “Escape Room” with a retro-themed font and style, and a button that says “press play” in the font Arcade Classic Regular. We used CSS as a way to make the title page look more aesthetic by centering all the text, adjusting the vertical location of the title and the button, and making the button change color when you hover a mouse over it.

We implemented the escape room as a website using HTML, CSS, and Flask. 
When you click on the “Press Play” button, you are redirected to Room 1. What a user will see in this page is a picture of an old-fashioned room. The user will need to click around to find different clues that are hidden. In code, we created transparent buttons in HTML and CSS that led to a pop up form that we created in HTML, Flask, and CSS. Once they find a button, a form would pop up where they are given puzzles to figure out. For room 1, it was ASCII themed. Room 2 had math problems, and room 3 had a theme of binary numbers. This form used flask: we implemented code that when the user inputted the right answer, a picture would appear in the bar on the top of the website. This picture would be a hint to the password that will allow them to escape the room. Thus, the user would then have to input a password in the form created by HTML, CSS, and Flask that is found at the bottom of the webpage. We followed the same format of Room 1 for Room 2 and Room 3. 
After Room 3, the users are redirected to the ending page. We used HTML and CSS to create the page, and it has a similar theme to the starting page. There is a pixelated city as the background, a title that states “you win” in a retro-themed font, and a button that states “play again” that will redirect users to the starting page.
Even though this is the end of creating this website for our final project, we are still excited to add more features to this website in the future. For example, we are thinking about coding in a timer and a time limit as well as creating more rooms and harder puzzles. Overall, we had a lot of fun creating this website, and we can’t wait for you to play it!
